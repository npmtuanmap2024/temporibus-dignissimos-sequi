# Philosophy

> **Poku**'s philosophy focuses on simplicity and efficiency, removing complexities to make testing accessible from the simplest to the most complex projects.

It's important to say that **Poku** doesn't aim to be better, but different:

- If you know **JavaScript**, you already know how to test (_even without **Poku**_)
  - _Didn't know about `assert`? Learning **Poku** is learning **JavaScript**_
- Just one line moves you from **Node.js** to **Poku** and vice versa
- **Poku** won't limit your test coverage in legacy environments
- Changing your **Runtime**? Carry your **Poku** with you:
  - [x] 游냥 + **Node.js**
  - [x] 游냥 + **TypeScript**
  - [x] 游냥 + **Bun**
  - [x] 游냥 + **Deno**

<hr />

Not only does **Poku** dispenses the need for new learning, by adopting assert with the same usability as **Node.js**, as he retains most of the popular features for test runners, while being naturally compatible with [**Node.js**][node-version-url], [**Bun**][bun-version-url] and [**Deno**][deno-version-url], including older versions, and it's truly **zero configuration**.

Moreover, **Poku** does away with the headache of dealing with different environments like **CJS** or **ESM**, as it adapts to any setting (even [**TypeScript**][typescript-url] without compilation when paired with [**tsx**][tsx]).

Also, **Poku** doesn't use a global state, allowing you to use it how and where you want.

Is it a cloud? No, it's **Poku**! It's not just lightweight; it doesn't even have external dependencies, allowing you to only add advanced features when really necessary.
